Abstract:
This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to the problem of spam email filtering. Using a preprocessed dataset where each email is represented by Boolean values indicating the presence or absence of specific words or characters, various classification algorithms are evaluated. The goal is to compare the performance of models such as Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression using 10-fold cross-validation. Statistical significance testing is performed to identify the best-performing model. The project also involves experimenting with improvement techniques to enhance predictive accuracy, with all results documented and reported systematically.
